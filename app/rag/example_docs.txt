It provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, modeling steps as nodes and edges in a graph.
It extends the LangChain Expression Language with the ability to coordinate multiple chains across multiple steps of computation.

FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.
It is based on standard Python type hints and provides automatic API documentation.

Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine, which can also serve as a powerful vector store for RAG.
It provides scalable full-text search and supports vector similarity search for semantic retrieval.

LangSmith is a platform for debugging, testing, and monitoring AI applications.
